Hospital Database Management System By Oracle SQL

Healthcare is a field that demands efficiency when it comes to processing vast amounts of
medical data and effectively treating patients. Within the last twenty years or so organizations
have had to face the daunting task of transferring medical data from file processing systems into
a robust relational database that can provide all parties with access to quick and reliable
medical/financial information
In the context of healthcare, workflow congestion could literally translate to life or death
for patients which means there is no room for inefficiencies when establishing an RDMS. Data
management is crucial for assessing patient info, arranging patient/doctor schedules and
accounting for the financial needs of the involved parties. The best method for attacking this
issue is to establish a database management system that can adequately deal with problems
relating to file security and information retrieval/updates.

Our proposed solution is to create a relational database that efficiently, securely and
succinctly processes medical information. The system would be able to digitally store patient
medical records, appointment schedules, medical staff directories, room assignments and billing
information. This approach would be less time consuming and more secure than a file processing
system which affords the user a much better experience. Automating the process would also
improve healthcare management and staff/patient interactions as greater precision would be
conducted in regards to planning. The patient would be able to plan their appointments, view
their billing statements and access their medical records on one secure platform ahead of time.
The beauty in this approach is that by minimizing logistical congestion in the hospital, you can
optimize the time spent being treated and cared for by medical personnel.
